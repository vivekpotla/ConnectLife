        <p className="text-gray-700">
        The blood donation process typically begins with registration and a brief medical screening to assess the donor's eligibility.

After donation, donors are provided with refreshments and monitored for any adverse reactions.

        <p className="text-gray-700">
        Blood donations come in various forms, each serving specific medical needs. Whole blood donation is the most common type and includes all blood components.

Double red cell donations are beneficial for patients requiring transfusions without the need for other blood components.

        <p className="text-gray-700">
        Donating blood not only helps others but also offers several health benefits to the donor. Regular blood donation can reduce the risk of certain diseases, including heart disease and certain cancers, by lowering iron levels in the body. However, donors may experience minor side effects such as dizziness, fatigue, or bruising at the donation site, which typically resolve quickly.
